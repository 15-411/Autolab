Todo list for winter break

->logrotate the production logs! 
	AFS is making this extremely difficult. logrotated is a good solution, but
	it doesn't play nicely with AFS.  /etc/cron.daily/autolab*  and
	log/autolab.logrotate 

->Put the link to meetings somewhere

->textboxes to set grades on gradesheet view (don't have to click to a seperate
screen)

->Quick functionality buttons for common things
-->Add 'NG' assignments for all missing students
-->View all students missing an assignment submission 

->Make gradebook generation faster
-->Allow instructors to refresh individual columns/rows
--> Seperate statistics generation from the entire gradebook (since it's taking up most of the time...0

->document code

->Finish the calendar!

->Figure out what happened to bulk upload of grades during the 213 final exam

->Charts/Graphs for grades

->Create a better interface / redesign the entire site!
-->Replace course and assignment .rb files with interfaces

->Deal with uploading specific extensions more gracefully.


FINISHED
======================
->add submitted_by to submissions, this will allow instructors to submit late
assignments for students!!! 

->Add concept of 'max score' for problems/assignments
->Interface for students to see their grace day usage

->Grade Statistics shouldn't include grades that don't exist


->Ability to delete/remove announcements (do we really need the archive of all the old ones?)
