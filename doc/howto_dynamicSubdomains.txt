HowTo: Create dynamic subdomains
===============================

This has NOTHING to do with autolab.  But Hunter needs a place to document this,
so why not? 

$ nsupdate -y keyname:key
 > server DDNS-MASTER.NET.CS.CMU.EDU
 > update add newDomain.fish.ics.cs.cmu.edu 3600 A IP.ADD.RE.SS 
 > 


 the key is in root. 

 Jeff Hutzleman (jhutz@cs.cmu.edu) is the giver of this power. If you have
 questions they can be directed at him. Tell him Hunter sent you.
